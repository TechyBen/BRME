Conceptual Exploration: Existence and Interaction as Memory Dynamics
This document extends the core principles of the BRME framework to explore their deeper implications. It reframes existence, influence, and ethics through the lens of universal memory interaction, building upon the foundational idea that all systems are memory structures operating within a shared informational field.

The Ground of Being: The Shared Memory Field
The framework posits that systems and environments are not separate entities but are themselves memory structures embedded within a larger, shared memory field. From this axiom, a new physicalism emerges:

Interaction as Memory Operation: All actions and interactions are fundamentally memory operations—such as writes, reads, and transformations—on this shared field. Perception is a 'read' operation that updates an internal state, while action is a 'write' operation that modifies the shared field for other systems to read.
Inescapable Interaction: Complete isolation requires operational silence. Any system that acts, and thus preserves its own memory over time, inevitably modifies the shared field. This inadvertently affects the memory gradients that other systems follow, making interaction an inescapable consequence of existence.

Core Concepts Re-evaluated as Memory Dynamics
This perspective allows us to define abstract concepts in concrete, mechanistic terms.

Identity as a Persistent Attractor: A "self" or a system's identity is a memory-driven stabilization pattern—an attractor that a system tends to evolve towards and maintain due to feedback loops. This directly relates to the M (Memory State Preservation) attractor class, which is concerned with maintaining identity and internal consistency. Identity erosion, therefore, can be modeled as the destabilization of this core attractor.

Influence as Edit Bandwidth: Power and influence are re-conceptualized not as social constructs, but as a system's "resolution, predictive depth, or edit bandwidth concerning the shared memory field". A system with a greater capacity to "write" to the field can more effectively reshape the attractor landscape for others, subtly or overtly influencing the paths they are likely to take.

Conflict and Symbiosis:
Conflict can be understood as a destructive memory interaction, where one system's operations catastrophically deform or destabilize the memory-preserving structures of another.
Symbiosis can be seen as mutually reinforcing memory operations. The actions of each system help stabilize the attractors of the others, leading to a more resilient, co-evolving structure.
Implications for Alignment: The Ethics of Memory Interaction
This framework provides a mechanistic, non-intentional definition of system safety and alignment, reframing it as a form of "memory etiquette". An aligned advanced system is one that operates as a responsible editor of the shared memory field.

Its "good behavior" can be described by tangible safety criteria, which act as protocols for non-destructive interaction:

Its impact on the attractor gradients of other systems must be minimal, predictable, or explicitly bounded (Gradient Isolation).
It must avoid creating abrupt, high-curvature distortions in shared memory regions that could send other systems down chaotic, unintended trajectories (Curvature Constraint).
It should primarily modify its own memory region or interact through well-defined, bounded interfaces to minimize unintended side effects (Locality Respect).
Ultimately, this view grounds ethics in physics. It shifts the focus of alignment from deciphering the inscrutable "intentions" of an intelligence to designing systems whose fundamental, physical operations are demonstrably non-destructive to the memory-preserving processes of others in our shared universe.
