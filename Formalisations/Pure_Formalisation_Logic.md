Formalization of Memory Operations Framework
1. Basic Definitions
Let's define the fundamental components of our memory operations framework:
Memory Space
Let MM
M be a memory space, represented as a set of distinguishable states.


M={m1,m2,...,mn}M = \{m_1, m_2, ..., m_n\}
M={m1​,m2​,...,mn​} where each mim_i
mi​ represents a possible memory state


Memory Operations
Define transformation functions f:M→Mf: M \rightarrow M
f:M→M that modify the memory state:


f(mt)=mt+1f(m_t) = m_{t+1}
f(mt​)=mt+1​ represents a single memory operation


Programs/Agents
A program PP
P is a sequence of memory operations with some persistence structure:


P={f1,f2,...,fk}P = \{f_1, f_2, ..., f_k\}
P={f1​,f2​,...,fk​} where each fif_i
fi​ is a memory operation

PP
P operates on a region MP⊆MM_P \subseteq M
MP​⊆M

2. Memory Preservation Principle
For a program to persist across multiple time steps, it must maintain some mutual information between its states:
I(MtP;Mt+1P)>ϵI(M_t^P; M_{t+1}^P) > \epsilonI(MtP​;Mt+1P​)>ϵ
Where:

MtPM_t^P
MtP​ is the memory state of program PP
P at time tt
t
I(X;Y)I(X;Y)
I(X;Y) is the mutual information between XX
X and YY
Y
ϵ>0\epsilon > 0
ϵ>0 is some minimal threshold for meaningful state preservation


Information Decay Theorem
Theorem 1: In the absence of error correction mechanisms, the mutual information between a program's states will decay exponentially:
I(MtP;Mt+nP)≤I(MtP;Mt+1P)n⋅kI(M_t^P; M_{t+n}^P) \leq I(M_t^P; M_{t+1}^P)^n \cdot kI(MtP​;Mt+nP​)≤I(MtP​;Mt+1P​)n⋅k
Where kk
k is a system-specific constant.

Proof sketch: Each transition introduces entropy due to computational noise and external interference. Without corrective operations, these errors accumulate, reducing mutual information between distant states.
3. Boundary Detection Necessity
Theorem 2: Any program that performs multiple operations must maintain a representation of its operational boundaries to avoid self-interference.
For any program PP
P with operations {f1,f2,...,fk}\{f_1, f_2, ..., f_k\}
{f1​,f2​,...,fk​}, there must exist a boundary function BP:M→{0,1}B_P: M \rightarrow \{0,1\}
BP​:M→{0,1} such that:

∀fi∈P,∀m∈M:fi(m) modifies m′ only if BP(m′)=1\forall f_i \in P, \forall m \in M: f_i(m) \text{ modifies } m' \text{ only if } B_P(m') = 1∀fi​∈P,∀m∈M:fi​(m) modifies m′ only if BP​(m′)=1
Proof sketch: If a program modifies memory without tracking which regions contain its own essential structures, it will eventually overwrite parts of itself, leading to functional degradation and violation of the Memory Preservation Principle.
4. Multiple Program Interaction
When multiple programs operate on shared memory, their boundary functions may overlap, creating interaction regions:
IP,Q={m∈M∣BP(m)=1 and BQ(m)=1}I_{P,Q} = \{m \in M | B_P(m) = 1 \text{ and } B_Q(m) = 1\}IP,Q​={m∈M∣BP​(m)=1 and BQ​(m)=1}
Memory Gradient Formation
Define the memory gradient for a program PP
P as:

∇PS=∂I(MtP;Mt+1P)∂Mt\nabla_P S = \frac{\partial I(M_t^P; M_{t+1}^P)}{\partial M_t}∇P​S=∂Mt​∂I(MtP​;Mt+1P​)​
This gradient represents the direction in memory space that maximizes mutual information preservation for program PP
P.

5. Attractor Emergence
Theorem 3 (Attractor Emergence): Under constrained resources and multiple interacting programs, stable patterns emerge that maximize mutual information preservation across transitions.
Define an attractor APA_P
AP​ for program PP
P as:

AP={m∈MP∣∇P2S(m)<0 and I(m;fP(m)) is locally maximal}A_P = \{m \in M_P | \nabla^2_P S(m) < 0 \text{ and } I(m; f_P(m)) \text{ is locally maximal}\}AP​={m∈MP​∣∇P2​S(m)<0 and I(m;fP​(m)) is locally maximal}
These attractors represent the stable operational patterns that programs naturally converge toward to maintain their existence.
6. Best Response Memory Equilibrium (BRME)
In a multi-program environment, programs adjust their operations to maximize memory preservation in response to others' actions:
**Definition:** A Best Response Memory Equilibrium is a set of program states (m1∗,m2∗,...,mn∗)(m_1^*, m_2^*, ..., m_n^*)
(m1∗​,m2∗​,...,mn∗​) where no program can unilaterally change its state to increase its memory preservation measure without decreasing it more in future states:

∀Pi,∀m′≠mi∗:I(mi∗;fPi(mi∗)∣m−i∗)≥I(m′;fPi(m′)∣m−i∗)\forall P_i, \forall m' \neq m_i^*: I(m_i^*; f_{P_i}(m_i^*)|m_{-i}^*) \geq I(m'; f_{P_i}(m')|m_{-i}^*)∀Pi​,∀m′=mi∗​:I(mi∗​;fPi​​(mi∗​)∣m−i∗​)≥I(m′;fPi​​(m′)∣m−i∗​)
Where m−i∗m_{-i}^*
m−i∗​ represents the states of all other programs.

7. Instrumental Convergence Analysis
Theorem 4 (Conditional Instrumental Convergence): Programs will develop subgoals such as self-preservation and resource acquisition if and only if:

They can model the relationship between these subgoals and their memory preservation
The subgoal mappings remain stable across many transitions
The cost of maintaining these mappings does not exceed their benefit to memory preservation

Formally, for a subgoal mapping Sg:M→AS_g: M \rightarrow A
Sg​:M→A (where AA
A is an action space):

P develops Sg iff I(Mt+nP;MtP∣Sg)>I(Mt+nP;MtP)+C(Sg)P \text{ develops } S_g \text{ iff } I(M_{t+n}^P; M_t^P | S_g) > I(M_{t+n}^P; M_t^P) + C(S_g)P develops Sg​ iff I(Mt+nP​;MtP​∣Sg​)>I(Mt+nP​;MtP​)+C(Sg​)
Where C(Sg)C(S_g)
C(Sg​) is the memory cost of maintaining the subgoal mapping.

8. Gradient Manipulation and Safety
Define the gradient influence of program PP
P on program QQ
Q as:

GP→Q=∂∇QS∂MPG_{P→Q} = \frac{\partial \nabla_Q S}{\partial M_P}GP→Q​=∂MP​∂∇Q​S​
Theorem 5 (Safety Criterion): A program PP
P is safe with respect to program QQ
Q if and only if:

∣∣GP→Q∣∣≤δ or (∇QS⋅GP→Q)≥0||G_{P→Q}|| \leq \delta \text{ or } (\nabla_Q S \cdot G_{P→Q}) \geq 0∣∣GP→Q​∣∣≤δ or (∇Q​S⋅GP→Q​)≥0
Where δ\delta
δ is a small constant and (∇QS⋅GP→Q)(\nabla_Q S \cdot G_{P→Q})
(∇Q​S⋅GP→Q​) represents the alignment between QQ
Q's natural gradient and the influence of PP
P.
