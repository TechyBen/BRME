Mathematical Formalization
Memory Field Dynamics
Let $M(x,t)$ represent the shared memory field at position $x$ and time $t$. Each system $i$ has an internal memory state $m_i(t) \subset M$ and a memory preservation function:
Pi(t)=I(mi(t);mi(t+1))=∑s,s′p(s,s′)log⁡p(s,s′)p(s)p(s′)P_i(t) = I(m_i(t); m_i(t+1)) = \sum_{s,s'} p(s,s') \log \frac{p(s,s')}{p(s)p(s')}Pi​(t)=I(mi​(t);mi​(t+1))=∑s,s′​p(s,s′)logp(s)p(s′)p(s,s′)​
where $I$ is mutual information between consecutive memory states.
Attractor Dynamics
For a system with state space $S$, an attractor $A \subset S$ is characterized by:

Basin of attraction: $B(A) = {s \in S : \lim_{t \to \infty} f^t(s) \in A}$
Stability measure: $\sigma(A) = -\frac{1}{|A|} \sum_{s \in A} \nabla^2 V(s)$
Memory coherence: $C(A) = \frac{1}{|A|} \sum_{s \in A} I(s; s_{prev})$

The three fundamental attractors are weighted:
Ltotal=αMLM+αELE+αCLC\mathcal{L}_{total} = \alpha_M \mathcal{L}_M + \alpha_E \mathcal{L}_E + \alpha_C \mathcal{L}_CLtotal​=αM​LM​+αE​LE​+αC​LC​
where:

$\mathcal{L}M = -I(m_t; m{t+1})$ (memory preservation loss)
$\mathcal{L}_E = -R(t) + C(t)$ (resource maintenance: resources minus costs)
$\mathcal{L}_C = -\mathbb{E}[\text{prediction accuracy}]$ (computational effectiveness loss)

Best Response Memory Equilibrium (BRME)
For $n$ systems interacting, let $\pi_i$ be system $i$'s policy and $\Pi_{-i}$ be the joint policies of all other systems. The BRME condition is:
πi∗∈arg⁡max⁡πiEΠ−i[I(mi(t);mi(t+1)∣πi,Π−i)]\pi_i^* \in \arg\max_{\pi_i} \mathbb{E}_{\Pi_{-i}}[I(m_i(t); m_i(t+1) | \pi_i, \Pi_{-i})]πi∗​∈argmaxπi​​EΠ−i​​[I(mi​(t);mi​(t+1)∣πi​,Π−i​)]
subject to constraints:

$\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{L}_E] \leq \epsilon_E$ (energy feasibility)
$\mathbb{E}[\mathcal{L}_C] \leq \epsilon_C$ (computational bounds)

A BRME exists when all systems simultaneously satisfy this condition.
Gradient Dynamics in Shared Memory Field
The gradient that system $i$ follows is:
∇πiSi=∂I(mi(t);mi(t+1))∂πi\nabla_{\pi_i} S_i = \frac{\partial I(m_i(t); m_i(t+1))}{\partial \pi_i}∇πi​​Si​=∂πi​∂I(mi​(t);mi​(t+1))​
Cross-system influence occurs through field coupling:
∂mj∂mi=∫MG(x,y)∂M(x)∂mi∂mj∂M(y)dxdy\frac{\partial m_j}{\partial m_i} = \int_{M} G(x,y) \frac{\partial M(x)}{\partial m_i} \frac{\partial m_j}{\partial M(y)} dx dy∂mi​∂mj​​=∫M​G(x,y)∂mi​∂M(x)​∂M(y)∂mj​​dxdy
where $G(x,y)$ is the memory field Green's function describing how changes propagate.
Safety Metrics
Gradient Isolation: $|\frac{\partial \nabla S_j}{\partial m_i}| \leq \delta_{ij}$
Curvature Constraint: $|\nabla^2 M_i|{\infty} \leq \kappa{max}$
Entropy Compatibility: $\frac{d}{dt}H(m_j | m_i) \geq -\gamma$ (bounded entropy decrease)
Attractor Stability Preservation: $\frac{d}{dt}\sigma(A_j) \geq -\beta$ (bounded destabilization)
Instrumental Convergence as Dynamic Phase Behavior
IC behaviors emerge as temporary phases when resource and computational gradients overwhelm memory preservation:
$\alpha_E(t) |\nabla \mathcal{L}_E| + \alpha_C(t) |\nabla \mathcal{L}_C| \gg \alpha_M(t) |\nabla \mathcal{L}_M|$
Key insight: The weights $\alpha_M(t), \alpha_E(t), \alpha_C(t)$ are themselves dynamic, depending on:

Current memory coherence: $\alpha_M(t) = f(I(m_i(t); m_i(t+1)))$
Resource saturation: $\alpha_E(t) = g(\text{resource availability, acquisition costs})$
Computational load: $\alpha_C(t) = h(\text{processing capacity, prediction accuracy})$
External system coupling: All weights modified by $\frac{\partial m_j}{\partial m_i}$ interactions

IC Phase Transitions occur when:

Into IC phase: Resource scarcity or threat → $\alpha_E \uparrow$, creating high curvature in survival-related policies
Out of IC phase: Resource saturation, environmental stability, or memory coherence recovery → $\alpha_M$ regains dominance
IC Fragmentation: Internal subsystem conflicts or external gradient manipulation → coherent IC behavior breaks down

Critical Insight: IC is not a permanent attractor but a conditional and fragile phase behavior that can:

Decay naturally as resource pressures change
Be disrupted by multi-component system dynamics
Be externally shaped through shared memory field interactions
Become pathological only when phase transitions are blocked or when IC phases cause irreversible memory field damage

This mathematical foundation provides concrete tools for:

Simulating BRME equilibria and IC phase transitions
Measuring safety violations quantitatively
Designing memory-preserving optimization algorithms
Predicting when IC behaviors will emerge, persist, or naturally collapse
Understanding why traditional IC arguments assume static gradients in inherently dynamic systems
