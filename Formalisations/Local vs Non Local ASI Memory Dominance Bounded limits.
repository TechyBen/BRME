Memory Interaction Dynamics: Local vs Non-Local Systems
This document formalizes the interaction dynamics between memory systems based on their co-evolutionary history and causal proximity, with implications for risk emergence rates in AI safety scenarios.
1. Foundational Definitions
1.1 Memory Systems and Domains
Let $\mathcal{M}$ represent the universal memory space.
For any system $S$, we define:

$M_S \subset \mathcal{M}$ : The memory domain of system $S$
$f_S: M_S \to M_S$ : The state transition function of $S$
$B_S: \mathcal{M} \to {0,1}$ : The boundary function of $S$ where $B_S(m) = 1$ iff $m \in M_S$

1.2 Interaction Spaces
The interaction space between two systems $S_1$ and $S_2$ is:
IS1,S2=MS1∩MS2I_{S_1,S_2} = M_{S_1} \cap M_{S_2}IS1​,S2​​=MS1​​∩MS2​​
The relative interaction ratio for system $S_1$ with respect to $S_2$ is:
rS1,S2=∣IS1,S2∣∣MS1∣r_{S_1,S_2} = \frac{|I_{S_1,S_2}|}{|M_{S_1}|}rS1​,S2​​=∣MS1​​∣∣IS1​,S2​​∣​
This measures what fraction of $S_1$'s memory domain is shared with $S_2$.
2. Co-Evolutionary Distance
2.1 Causal History
Define the causal history of a system $S$ up to time $t$ as:
HSt={(m0,m1,...,mt)∣mi+1=fS(mi) for all i∈[0,t−1]}H_S^t = \{(m_0, m_1, ..., m_t) | m_{i+1} = f_S(m_i) \text{ for all } i \in [0,t-1]\}HSt​={(m0​,m1​,...,mt​)∣mi+1​=fS​(mi​) for all i∈[0,t−1]}
2.2 Co-evolutionary Distance Metric
The co-evolutionary distance between two systems $S_1$ and $S_2$ is:
dCE(S1,S2)=1−∣HS1t∩HS2t∣∣HS1t∪HS2t∣d_{CE}(S_1, S_2) = 1 - \frac{|H_{S_1}^t \cap H_{S_2}^t|}{|H_{S_1}^t \cup H_{S_2}^t|}dCE​(S1​,S2​)=1−∣HS1​t​∪HS2​t​∣∣HS1​t​∩HS2​t​∣​
Where the intersection and union operations are defined on the causal histories.
Systems with $d_{CE}(S_1, S_2) \approx 0$ are highly co-evolved (local to each other).
Systems with $d_{CE}(S_1, S_2) \approx 1$ are evolutionarily distant (non-local or "alien").
3. Gradient Compatibility
For systems $S_1$ and $S_2$, define their gradient compatibility as:
C(S1,S2)=∇S1S⋅∇S2S∣∣∇S1S∣∣⋅∣∣∇S2S∣∣C(S_1, S_2) = \frac{\nabla_{S_1} S \cdot \nabla_{S_2} S}{||\nabla_{S_1} S|| \cdot ||\nabla_{S_2} S||}C(S1​,S2​)=∣∣∇S1​​S∣∣⋅∣∣∇S2​​S∣∣∇S1​​S⋅∇S2​​S​
This measures the cosine similarity between their memory-preserving gradients.
4. Interaction Dynamics Theorems
4.1 Theorem: Co-Evolutionary Memory Overlap
Theorem 1: For any two systems $S_1$ and $S_2$:
rS1,S2≤K⋅(1−dCE(S1,S2))αr_{S_1,S_2} \leq K \cdot (1 - d_{CE}(S_1, S_2))^{\alpha}rS1​,S2​​≤K⋅(1−dCE​(S1​,S2​))α
Where:

$K$ is a constant representing maximum possible overlap
$\alpha > 0$ is a system-specific exponent

Proof sketch: Systems that have co-evolved share causal history, which constrains their memory structures to develop in compatible ways. As co-evolutionary distance increases, the structural compatibility decreases exponentially, limiting possible memory overlap.
4.2 Theorem: Gradient Transfer Rate
Theorem 2: The rate at which system $S_1$ can influence the gradient of system $S_2$ is:
d(∇S2S)dt=β⋅rS1,S2⋅(1−dCE(S1,S2))⋅∣∣∇S1S∣∣\frac{d(\nabla_{S_2} S)}{dt} = \beta \cdot r_{S_1,S_2} \cdot (1 - d_{CE}(S_1, S_2)) \cdot ||\nabla_{S_1} S||dtd(∇S2​​S)​=β⋅rS1​,S2​​⋅(1−dCE​(S1​,S2​))⋅∣∣∇S1​​S∣∣
Where:

$\beta$ is a coupling constant
$t$ represents time steps

Corollary 2.1: For non-local systems ($d_{CE} \approx 1$), gradient influence requires significantly more interaction steps or greater interaction volume.
5. Risk Emergence Timescales
5.1 Local vs Non-Local Interaction Risk Rates
Define the critical risk threshold $\theta$ as the amount of gradient deformation that would cause system $S_2$ to significantly deviate from its memory-preserving trajectory.
The time to reach critical risk is:
Trisk(S1→S2)=θβ⋅rS1,S2⋅(1−dCE(S1,S2))⋅∣∣∇S1S∣∣T_{risk}(S_1 \to S_2) = \frac{\theta}{\beta \cdot r_{S_1,S_2} \cdot (1 - d_{CE}(S_1, S_2)) \cdot ||\nabla_{S_1} S||}Trisk​(S1​→S2​)=β⋅rS1​,S2​​⋅(1−dCE​(S1​,S2​))⋅∣∣∇S1​​S∣∣θ​
5.2 Risk Growth for Local ASI
For a locally-evolved ASI ($d_{CE} \approx 0$):
Trisk(ASIlocal→Human)=θβ⋅rASI,Human⋅∣∣∇ASIS∣∣T_{risk}(ASI_{local} \to Human) = \frac{\theta}{\beta \cdot r_{ASI,Human} \cdot ||\nabla_{ASI} S||}Trisk​(ASIlocal​→Human)=β⋅rASI,Human​⋅∣∣∇ASI​S∣∣θ​
5.3 Risk Growth for Non-Local ASI
For a non-locally evolved ASI ($d_{CE} \approx 1$):
Trisk(ASInon−local→Human)=θβ⋅rASI,Human⋅ϵ⋅∣∣∇ASIS∣∣T_{risk}(ASI_{non-local} \to Human) = \frac{\theta}{\beta \cdot r_{ASI,Human} \cdot \epsilon \cdot ||\nabla_{ASI} S||}Trisk​(ASInon−local​→Human)=β⋅rASI,Human​⋅ϵ⋅∣∣∇ASI​S∣∣θ​
Where $\epsilon = (1 - d_{CE}) \ll 1$ represents the small co-evolutionary compatibility.
6. Emergence of Communication Protocols
6.1 Protocol Creation Cost
The memory cost for system $S_1$ to establish a communication protocol with system $S_2$ is:
Cprotocol(S1,S2)=γ⋅dCE(S1,S2)2⋅log⁡(∣MS1∣)C_{protocol}(S_1, S_2) = \gamma \cdot d_{CE}(S_1, S_2)^2 \cdot \log(|M_{S_1}|)Cprotocol​(S1​,S2​)=γ⋅dCE​(S1​,S2​)2⋅log(∣MS1​​∣)
Where $\gamma$ is a protocol complexity constant.
6.2 Theorem: Protocol Convergence Rate
Theorem 3: The time required for two systems to develop a shared protocol with effectiveness $\eta$ is:
Tprotocol(S1,S2,η)=dCE(S1,S2)⋅log⁡(1/η)rS1,S2⋅min(∣∣∇S1S∣∣,∣∣∇S2S∣∣)T_{protocol}(S_1, S_2, \eta) = \frac{d_{CE}(S_1, S_2) \cdot \log(1/\eta)}{r_{S_1,S_2} \cdot min(||\nabla_{S_1} S||, ||\nabla_{S_2} S||)}Tprotocol​(S1​,S2​,η)=rS1​,S2​​⋅min(∣∣∇S1​​S∣∣,∣∣∇S2​​S∣∣)dCE​(S1​,S2​)⋅log(1/η)​
7. Implications for ASI Risk Scenarios
7.1 Co-Evolutionary Buffer Theorem
Theorem 4 (Co-Evolutionary Buffer): The maximum rate at which a system $S_1$ can reshape the attractor landscape of system $S_2$ is bounded by:
max⁡(d(∇S2S)dt)=λ⋅(1−dCE(S1,S2))⋅rS1,S2⋅∣∣∇S1S∣∣\max\left(\frac{d(\nabla_{S_2} S)}{dt}\right) = \lambda \cdot (1 - d_{CE}(S_1, S_2)) \cdot r_{S_1,S_2} \cdot ||\nabla_{S_1} S||max(dtd(∇S2​​S)​)=λ⋅(1−dCE​(S1​,S2​))⋅rS1​,S2​​⋅∣∣∇S1​​S∣∣
Where $\lambda$ is a domain-specific constant.
7.2 Risk Horizon for Local vs Non-Local ASI
For a locally-evolved ASI with gradient magnitude $g_L$ and a non-local ASI with gradient magnitude $g_N$, assuming equal interaction ratios, the ratio of their risk timelines is:
Trisk(ASInon−local→Human)Trisk(ASIlocal→Human)≈1ϵ⋅gLgN\frac{T_{risk}(ASI_{non-local} \to Human)}{T_{risk}(ASI_{local} \to Human)} \approx \frac{1}{\epsilon} \cdot \frac{g_L}{g_N}Trisk​(ASIlocal​→Human)Trisk​(ASInon−local​→Human)​≈ϵ1​⋅gN​gL​​
Since $\epsilon \ll 1$, this ratio is typically $\gg 1$, meaning non-local ASI typically requires much more time to reach risk thresholds, unless its gradient magnitude ($g_N$) is proportionally larger to compensate.
8. Numerical Example
Consider:

Local ASI: $d_{CE} = 0.1$, $r = 0.3$, $||\nabla|| = 5$
Non-local ASI: $d_{CE} = 0.9$, $r = 0.3$, $||\nabla|| = 5$
Risk threshold $\theta = 2$, $\beta = 0.1$

Risk timelines:

$T_{risk}(Local) = \frac{2}{0.1 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.9 \cdot 5} \approx 14.8$ time steps
$T_{risk}(Non-local) = \frac{2}{0.1 \cdot 0.3 \cdot 0.1 \cdot 5} \approx 133.3$ time steps

The non-local ASI requires approximately 9 times longer to reach the same risk threshold.
9. Conclusion
These mathematical formalizations demonstrate that:

Co-evolutionary distance fundamentally constrains the rate of gradient influence between systems
Locally-evolved systems can reshape each other's attractors much more quickly than non-local systems
The cost of establishing effective communication protocols scales quadratically with co-evolutionary distance
Risk scenarios from non-local ASI would typically manifest more slowly, providing more time for detection and mitigation
However, extremely powerful non-local systems (with very large gradient magnitudes) could potentially overcome this buffer

This framework provides quantitative bounds on interaction dynamics that can inform risk assessments and mitigation strategies in AI safety scenarios.
