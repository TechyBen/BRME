Simulation Design: The Rabies Virus as a BRME Case Study
1. Objective
To model a biological host-pathogen system within the BRME framework, demonstrating how a simple memory-preserving program (virus) can catastrophically reshape the attractor landscape of a complex system (host) to facilitate its own replication. This model will explicitly avoid agentic language.

2. Component Definitions
The Shared Memory Field (M): The host organism's Central Nervous System (CNS). The state of M is defined by neuronal structures, neurotransmitter concentrations, and signal pathways.
The Host System (S_host): The host's brain and nervous system.
Primary Attractor (A_host_normal): Represents normal, healthy neurological function. This is a complex, stable pattern characterized by behaviors that support the host's M (identity/memory) and E (energy/resource) attractors, such as self-preservation, feeding, and regulated social interaction.
The Viral System (S_virus): The rabies virus.
Core Program: A simple memory structure (viral RNA) whose execution is defined by a single, overriding attractor: successful replication of its memory (M (Memory State Preservation)). The virus does not have E or C attractors in the same way the host does; its physical structure is its program.
3. Interaction Dynamics: Destructive Write Operations
The virus's interaction with the host is a classic example of Interaction as Gradient Manipulation.

The viral replication process performs write operations directly on the host's memory field (M). It alters neuronal function and the production of neurotransmitters.
The virus is not "fighting" the host. It is a program executing in a new environment, and its execution fundamentally changes the operational physics of that environment. This is a form of Asymmetric Cognition; the virus's simple, robust program can systematically deconstruct the host's far more complex but fragile system.
4. Attractor Hijacking
The simulation will model the following process:

Destabilization: The initial viral write operations introduce noise and errors into M, destabilizing the A_host_normal attractor. The host's normal behaviors begin to degrade.
Drift and Capture: As the viral program continues to execute, its write operations do not just introduce random noise. They systematically push the host's state toward a new, pathological attractor: A_host_rabid.
The New Attractor (A_host_rabid): This new, stable pattern is characterized by behaviors like aggression, agitation, and hydrophobia. Crucially, these behaviors are instrumentally convergent for the virus's memory preservation.
Aggression (Biting): Maximizes the probability of the virus being physically transferred to a new host, allowing its program to run on new "hardware."
Hydrophobia: Prevents the host from drinking, which would wash away the high concentration of viral particles in the saliva, thus maximizing the dosage per bite.
The host has not "chosen" these behaviors. Its own gradients have been so thoroughly reshaped by the virus that its new path of least resistance—its new stable equilibrium—is a set of actions that directly serves the replication of the external program it is infected with. This is Drift Non-Enforcement in its most potent form: the virus injects structures that force uncontrolled attractor drift in the host.

5. Metrics for Observation
Host Attractor Integrity: A measure of the host's state deviation from the basin of A_host_normal.
Viral Replication Rate: The measure of success for S_virus's M-drive.
Correlation: Map the correlation between the degradation of the host's attractor and the increase in behaviors that have a high probability of causing viral transmission.
This simulation demonstrates the core thesis of BRME alignment: safety is not about goals, but about ensuring one system's operations do not mechanistically rewrite the attractor landscape of another in a way that hijacks it for its own memory-preserving ends.
